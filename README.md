# Python-optimization
This repository contains information about discrete optimization in Python. Python offers a lot of functionalities for discrete optimization, although it might be sometimes difficult to find or choose the correct library. This repository is a working document where i will write down my progress with python optimization.


The goals of this repository are:
- Give a clear overview of which libraries can be used for different optimization techniques.
- Provide basic information in using these libraries or link to locations where this information can be found.
- Provide code and explanation for optimization techniques for which no library can be found
